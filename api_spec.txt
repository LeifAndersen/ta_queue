/*
 *  TA Queue API Spec
 *
 *  This API follows typical RESTful/Rails conventions for creating/reading/updating/destroying (CRUD) resources, such as Boards, Students, and TA's.
 *
 *  Please read this entire spec before building a client, as it clarifies conventions used in the API and general tips.
 *
 *  Resource Specs
 *  =================
 * 
 *  Board -
 *    Boards are the highest level resource. It is called a Board (as opposed to a Queue) because there will be future additions to this app besides
 *    the Queue portion, such as a discussion board and others, all of which will be part of the Board.
 *
 *    Associations -
 *        has_one queue
 *        has_one ...     // Other stuff will be added in the future
 *        has_many students
 *        has_many tas    // tas is the plural of TA
 *  TA -
 *    TA's are authorized to change their own state (such as username, status, etc), the state of the Queue (active/inactive, frozen/unfrozen), as
 *    well as some of the state of a student (in queue/not in queue).
 *
 *    Associations -
 *      belongs_to board
 *      has_one student // The student they are currently helping, nil if they aren't helping anyone 
 *
 *  Student -
 *    Students are authorized to change their own state, including username, location, and whether they're in the Queue or not
 *
 *    Associations -
 *      belongs_to board
 *      belongs_to ta
 *
 *  NOTES:
 *  ==============
 *
 *  We will here make a distinction between changing the "state" of a resource (such as a Student's username) and performing an "action", such as
 *  entering the queue, etc.
 *
 *  State:
 *  -----------------
 *  Following Rails conventions in passing parameters, if you are updating the "state" of a resource, you must put the attribute you intend to
 *  update in square brackets ([ ]) after the resource you are updating . If you wanted to update the username of a TA, you would pass the following:
 *  
 *    PUT /boards/:board_title/tas/:id
 *    Parameters:
 *      {
 *        ta[username] = "some new username"
 *      }
 *
 *  Same goes for creation:
 *
 *  Action:
 *  -----------------
 *  When performing an action, such as adding yourself to the queue, those actions will be performed by a single GET request with no parameters
 *  via URL extensions (as much as possible).
 *
 *  For example, if you are a student and you want to enter the queue, you would perform the following request:
 *
 *    GET /boards/:board_title/queue/enter_queue
 *
 *  Since you are using HTTP Basic authentication (read further down in the notes for clarification on HTTP Basic), the server will be able to
 *  figure out that you are a student and add you to the queue. If you were a TA, it would reject the request.
 *
 *  NOTE: The general convention is the following: when an action occurs between two resources, it's the receiving resource that implements the action.
 *        In the above example, the Queue is the receiver of the action from the Student, so it is part of the Queue API, not the Student's.
 *
 *  Other Examples of performing actions:
 *
 *    TA accepting a student:
 *
 *      GET /boards/:board_title/students/:student_id/ta_accept
 *
 *    TA removing a student:
 *
 *      GET /boards/:board_title/students/:student_id/ta_remove_from_queue
 *
 *    Student exiting the Queue:
 *  
 *      GET /boards/:board_title/queue/exit_queue
 *  
 *    Student upvoting a discussion question (Not yet implemented, just an example)
 *
 *      GET /boards/:board_title/discussion/questions/:id/upvote
 *
 *  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  The notion of "logging in/out" is synonymous with creating and deleting: to create a TA or Student is to login, and to destroy them is to logout.
 *  Upon creating a Student or TA, the client will recieve that User's username, id, and token in response. The id and token should be stored somewhere
 *  persistent as it will be used in most other requests as a sort of "username and password"
 *
 *  HTTP Basic:
 *  ---------------------------
 *  HTTP Basic is a method of authenticating where you send your username and password in the HTTP Header. See this wikipedia article for further clarification:
 *  
 *    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication
 *
 *  Note that you will need to base64-encode the credentials, most frameworks have this implemented, or one is surely available on the internet somewhere
 *  ---------------------------
 *
 *  In an effort to keep the state of the Board current in terms of who is logged in and who is not, there will also be some notion of "staying alive" 
 *  where clients will be required in some way to notify the server on a regular basis that they are still logged in. The database will be purged fairly
 *  regularly (anywhere from every couple of minutes to every half hour, depending on what is decided) to keep the state current. We welcome feedback
 *  on the best approach to this.
 *
 *  Web browsers can "fake" PUT and DELETE requests to the server
 *  by sending _method:"PUT" or _method:"DELETE" in the parameters of
 *  a POST request
