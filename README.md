### TA Queue

A TA queue for TA's/Teachers to use to visit students in a computer lab in an orderly fashion. You can test out a demo
at nine.eng.utah.edu/boards/demo/login (password is `demo`)

This TA Queue is currently only functioning for the University of Utah, but plans to be expanded to other universities.
Currently, any University may host it on their own server, however.
